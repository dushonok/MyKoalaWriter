Got some leftover pork tenderloin staring at you from the fridge like it owns the place?

Good news—you can turn it into something way more exciting than a sad reheated plate. Leftover pork tenderloin makes the perfect filling for crispy, golden empanadas that taste like you actually planned dinner.

You don’t need fancy skills or hours in the kitchen. With simple dough and a handful of pantry staples, you’ll have flaky pockets of goodness that disappear faster than you can say “takeout.”

Stick around and you’ll find out what tools make life easier. I’ll walk you through the exact ingredients you’ll need and step-by-step instructions that won’t make you break a sweat.

Equipment

You don’t need a full-blown bakery setup, but a few basics will save you from empanada chaos.

Keep it simple, or you’ll end up washing more dishes than eating pastries.

Must-haves:

Mixing bowl (for tossing pork and fillings, not for your cereal)
Rolling pin (or a wine bottle in a pinch—classy)
Baking sheet (lined with parchment, unless you enjoy scrubbing)
Nice-to-haves:

Pastry cutter or biscuit cutter (to make circles look like circles)
Fork (for crimping edges and pretending you’re fancy)
Brush (for egg wash, not for painting the cat)
Tool	Purpose	Backup Option
Rolling Pin	Flatten dough	Wine bottle
Pastry Cutter	Cut circles	Drinking glass
Pastry Brush	Apply egg wash	Spoon + hope
If you’ve got these, you’re ready. If not, improvise—you’re making empanadas, not rocket ships.

Ingredients

You’re about to turn last night’s pork tenderloin into today’s snack-sized miracle.

Don’t worry, your fridge leftovers are finally getting their big moment.

Here’s what you’ll need to pull this off without calling your mom for help:

Filling & Dough

2 cups leftover pork tenderloin, shredded
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or Monterey Jack)
1/4 cup chopped olives (optional, but fancy)
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 package empanada dough discs (or pie crust if you’re rebellious)
For Baking/Finishing

1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
What You Need To Know: Cold pork shreds easier than warm pork.

Instructions
Roll out your dough like you’re auditioning for a bakery reality show—thin, but not see-through.

Spoon a bit of pork filling onto the center. Don’t overstuff unless you want a pork explosion.

Add cheese if you like things gooey.

Fold the dough over into a half-moon. Press edges with a fork to seal. This also makes them look fancy.

Place the empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Nobody likes a stuck pastry.

Brush the tops with egg wash for that golden “I totally know what I’m doing” look.

Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden brown.

Let them cool slightly before biting in, unless you enjoy burning the roof of your mouth.

What You Need To Know
You’re about to stuff leftover pork tenderloin into dough pockets. That basically makes you a culinary magician.

No wand required, just a little leftover magic.

Empanadas work with a lot of fillings, but pork tenderloin brings flavor without all the grease. Less mess on your baking sheet, more actual food in your belly.

You can totally use store-bought empanada dough. Puff pastry works, too.

If you go with tortillas, well, that’s bold—just don’t call them empanadas unless you’re ready for some side-eye.

Quick Tips:

Drain the pork well. No one wants a soggy pocket.
Cheese is optional, but honestly, who skips cheese?
Bake or fry, depending on your mood (or your conscience).
This recipe is kind of a fridge-cleaning hack in disguise. You save money, waste less, and somehow still look like you planned dinner on purpose.

Cooking Moroccan chickpea stew is about using cozy spices, picking the right veggies, and knowing which shortcuts actually work. From slow cooker secrets to stew-thickening magic, here’s what you need to know.

What's the secret to getting that slow cooker Moroccan chickpea stew to taste like a hug in a bowl?
The secret is layering flavors. Sauté onions, garlic, and spices before tossing them into the slow cooker. It may tempt you to skip, but this tiny step gives you deep flavor. Plus, letting it simmer for hours makes everything taste extra cozy, just like a warm blanket—except you can eat it.

Check out tips for the perfect slow cooker technique.

How can I whip up a Moroccan chickpea stew so easy that even my cat could do it?
Keep it simple. Use canned chickpeas—they’re already cooked and save you time. Dump everything in one pot: canned chickpeas, diced tomatoes, chopped veggies, broth, and Moroccan spices like cumin, coriander, and cinnamon. Let it all simmer until your kitchen smells amazing (and your cat gets jealous).

Here's more on making super easy Moroccan chickpea stew.

Is the BBC hoarding a top-secret Moroccan chickpea stew recipe that's better than my grandma's?
The BBC might have fancy cameras, but there is no secret recipe hiding in London. Moroccan chickpea stew is beloved everywhere, and most versions use the same basics: chickpeas, tomatoes, vegetables, and plenty of spices. Your grandma’s magic touch probably came from an extra pinch of paprika or TLC, not a BBC vault.

Can you spill the beans on what makes a Moroccan chickpea curry outrageously good?
There’s a certain magic in the way the spices come together. Cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cinnamon—each one does its thing, but together? Something special happens.

Letting it all simmer is key. The flavors need time to get cozy and really settle in.

Right at the end, a hit of fresh herbs and a squeeze of lemon brings it all to life. That’s usually when you realize you’re onto something.

You can read more about spicy flavor combos in this chickpea stew guide.

Got any magical tips for transforming my Moroccan stew from 'meh' to 'more, please' with a thickening spell?
If your stew’s feeling a bit thin, just mash some of the chickpeas right in the pot. That little trick thickens things up in no time.

Letting it simmer uncovered helps too. Sometimes, patience does most of the work.

Adding a spoonful of tomato paste is another solid move for both texture and flavor. It’s one of those things you just have to try.

Some cooks swear by tossing in sweet potatoes or carrots for extra heartiness. For more tips, see this stew-thickening advice.

What's the deal with Moroccan chickpea tagine, and how's it different from just plopping chickpeas in a pot?
A tagine is both a spiced stew and a funny-looking clay pot from Morocco. Cooking with a tagine makes steam rise, then drip back down, keeping everything inside really tender.

If you don't have a tagine, a regular pot will do the trick. Still, that classic tagine shape gives the dish a unique texture and a deeper, richer flavor—it's just not quite the same without it.

Thanksgiving doesn’t always need a giant turkey taking over your oven. A garlic butter roast chicken gives you juicy meat, crispy skin, and way less stress.

It’s the perfect swap when you want all the holiday flavor without wrestling a bird the size of a toddler.

You’ll slather a whole chicken with garlic herb butter, stuff it with aromatics, and let the oven do the heavy lifting.

The result? Golden, tender, and packed with flavor that makes everyone forget about turkey.

With the right equipment, simple ingredients, and clear steps, you’ll pull off a main dish that feels festive but won’t leave you exhausted.

Equipment
You don’t need a kitchen full of gadgets to pull this off. A few basics will save you from wrestling with raw chicken like it’s a slippery football.

Must-haves:

Roasting pan (or a baking dish big enough to hold your bird without it hanging over the edge).
Meat thermometer (because guessing “eh, looks done” is not a safe cooking method).
Sharp knife (for carving, not for threatening anyone who steals crispy skin).
Nice-to-haves:

Basting brush to slather on that garlic butter like a pro.
Kitchen twine to tie the legs together so your chicken doesn’t do yoga poses in the oven.
Tool	Why You Need It
Roasting Pan	Holds the chicken steady and catches tasty drippings
Thermometer	Ensures juicy meat without mystery pink spots
Twine	Keeps the bird neat and cooks more evenly
Keep it simple. If you’ve got an oven, a pan, and some butter, you’re already halfway to victory.

Ingredients

You can’t roast a chicken with just good vibes, so grab these basics. Think of it as your edible toolkit—minus the screws and hammer.

Shopping List:

1 whole chicken (about 4 lbs)
4 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 lemon, halved
1 onion, quartered
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp fresh thyme, chopped
1 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped
Tip: Fresh herbs make you look fancy, even if you still burn toast.

What You Need To Know: The secret to this chicken? It’s all about getting that skin crackly and golden, while the meat stays juicy. Nobody wants a dry bird on Thanksgiving, right?

Instructions
Pat the chicken dry like you’re giving it a spa day. Dry skin = crispy skin.

Rub the garlic butter mixture all over the chicken. Yes, even under the skin. Don’t be shy—it’s not judging you.

Stuff the cavity with herbs, onion, and lemon. Think of it as decorating a very tiny living room.

Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. This keeps everything neat and helps the bird cook evenly.

Place the chicken in a roasting pan, breast side up. Nobody wants upside-down dinner.

Roast in the oven until the skin is golden and the juices run clear.

Halfway through, spoon some pan juices over the chicken. It’s basically a basting spa treatment.

Rest the chicken before carving. This lets the juices settle so you don’t end up with dry meat and soggy tears.

What You Need To Know
Roasting a whole chicken isn’t rocket science. You don’t need to overthink it.

Just let the oven do its thing while you sneak a bite of mashed potatoes and pretend you’re on a cooking show.

Quick Tips:

If you want crispy skin, pat that chicken dry. Seriously, don’t skip it.
Let your chicken rest after roasting—it’s worth the wait.
Fresh herbs are a game changer, but hey, use what you’ve got.
Step	Why It Matters
Dry chicken	Crispy skin
Butter under skin	Juicy meat
Rest after roasting	Keeps it tender
The smell of roast chicken? It’s almost unfair. Your guests might never want to leave.
